  <p>
We investigate intermediaries demand for long-term cash flows by estimating a characteristic-based demand system on the equity holdings of primary dealers, pension funds, banks, and insurance companies. 
Institutions’ demand for equity duration varies over time and in the cross-section as a function of measures of capital availability. 
In the time-series, when financial constraints are tight, institutions curtail their demand for long-term claims and become more exposed to reinvestment risk. 
In the cross section, unconstrained institutions tilt their portfolio more strongly toward long-duration stocks compared to their constrained peers. 
We conclude that institutional constraints impair the ability to seek for the hedging properties of long-duration claims, to the point that institutions may be forced to leave their “preferred-habitat” allocation. 
Counterfactual analysis shows that shifts in preference for duration generate sizeable effects in the cross-section of stocks, with a stronger impact on firms with long-term cash flows.  </p>
