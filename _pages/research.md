Stocks with long-term cash flows earn lower expected returns because they hedge fluctuations in investment opportunities. We study the role of financial institutions in shaping this duration premium using equity holdings of primary dealers, pension funds, banks, and insurance companies. We find that intermediaries’ demand for equity duration varies systematically with their risk-bearing capacity. In the time series, institutions reduce their demand for long-duration claims and increase their exposure to reinvestment risk when aggregate capital ratios are low. Such a result extends cross-sectionally: better-capitalized and better-performing institutions tilt their portfolios more strongly toward long-duration stocks than their constrained peers. These patterns align with an ICAPM framework in which hedging demand declines with risk aversion. Counterfactual exercises show that shifts in intermediaries’ preferences generate monotonic changes in expected returns across duration deciles, with especially large effects when demand shocks operate at the holding-company level.

  <p>
We investigate intermediaries demand for long-term cash flows by estimating a characteristic-based demand system on the equity holdings of primary dealers, pension funds, banks, and insurance companies. 
Institutions’ demand for equity duration varies over time and in the cross-section as a function of measures of capital availability. 
In the time-series, when financial constraints are tight, institutions curtail their demand for long-term claims and become more exposed to reinvestment risk. 
In the cross section, unconstrained institutions tilt their portfolio more strongly toward long-duration stocks compared to their constrained peers. 
We conclude that institutional constraints impair the ability to seek for the hedging properties of long-duration claims, to the point that institutions may be forced to leave their “preferred-habitat” allocation. 
Counterfactual analysis shows that shifts in preference for duration generate sizeable effects in the cross-section of stocks, with a stronger impact on firms with long-term cash flows.  </p>
